# Growth Product Manager Nanodegree
 Project 01:In this project, I assumed the role of the Growth Product Manager at Craft Snacks, 
a hypothetical e-commerce company offering monthly subscriptions of artisan snack boxes.
 I created a presentation deck to propose a user acquisition and growth plan based on the business context that was provided for me.
 The presentation deck consists of four main sections: Inspecting the landscape, Mapping the Path to Growth, Validating the Path to Growth, and Developing a Growth Vision. I demonstrated My skills to assess the current state of the business as is, and then chart the path to the future to-be state by building my own growth loop, setting up a test that validates the loop, and proposing an expansion to the loop.
 
Project02: Act as the Growth Product Manager for Productboard and Slack to optimize the sign-up flow to ensure maximum conversions, determine the activation funnel, create a retention curve, and perform a churn analysis. Then, suggest experiments to improve overall activation and retention.

Project 03:Build a monetization model for a post-revenue B2B SaaS business, and then come up with hypotheses about potential changes to the monetization strategy including changing pricing metrics and plans.
